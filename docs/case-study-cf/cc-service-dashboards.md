# `cc-service-dashboards`

Single Sign-On (SSO) enables Cloud Foundry (CF) users to authenticate with third-party service dashboards using their CF credentials. Service dashboards are web interfaces which enable users to interact with some or all of the features the service offers. SSO provides a streamlined experience for users, limiting repeated logins and multiple accounts across their managed services. The userâ€™s credentials are never directly transmitted to the service since the OAuth protocol handles authentication.

To enable the SSO feature, the Cloud Controller requires a UAA client with sufficient permissions to create and delete clients for the service brokers that request them. This client can be configured by including the following snippet in the cf-release manifest:

```yaml
cc-service-dashboards:
  authorities: clients.read,clients.write,clients.admin
  authorized-grant-types: client_credentials
  scope: openid,cloud_controller_service_permissions.read
  secret: ((uaa_clients_cc-service-dashboards_secret))
```
